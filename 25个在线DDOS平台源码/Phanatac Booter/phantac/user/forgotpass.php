 * This page is for those users who have forgotten their
 * password and want to have a new password generated for
 * them and sent to the email address attached to their
 * account in the database. The new password is not
 * displayed on the website for security purposes.
 *
 * Note: If your server is not properly setup to send
 * mail, then this page is essentially useless and it
 * would be better to not even link to this page from
 * your website.
